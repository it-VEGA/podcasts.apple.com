The episode did not disappoint and I resonated with several things Matt spoke about being a perfectionist within myself that I’d like to address.

It’s a busy time right now, and hearing so much great advice already from this podcast of how family comes first and then business, really motivates me to better align my life. I listened to the episode with Matt Drinkhahn and he talked about whenever he feels guilt and shame he writes in his journal, “welcome. I know I have something to learn from you.” And has a great perspective on how to manage it as a dad.",

To hear the perspective, philosophy, vulnerability, advice, wins, losses, improvements, spirituality, etc from other dads who are entrepreneurs brings so much value to the listeners to be a better dad, individual, community member, and business person. Family is something sacred and needs to be protected especially in our current times where it’s easy to get distracted and pulled away from the hustle and bustle of every day life. Business always took the driver seat while everything else went to the wayside.

The episode with Jesse Harless offered an amazing reframe for addiction and the how the stigma of the word prevents us from acknowledging what addictions we have. The fresh definition also allowed me to identify actions I need to work on and addictions I need to manage better. I also really enjoyed trying cold showers. He gave me that push to give it a shot. The episode with Nate Klemp was great as well. As my fianceé and I build our relationship and marriage the concept of fairness and balance just naturally come up as a part of typical relationship culture. His 80-80 concert really opened my eyes to new possibilities and potentials about how we both create a relationship that provides space for us to each thrive as individuals as well as a couple. That framework will be pivotal moving forward. Lastly the episode with Krister Ungerböck was great. Not only does he talk about the importance of language and how it impacts all areas of our lives via relationships, but he includes training and actions to move into better and more effective directions with language. The learning and information behind the shifts are also fascinating. As I progress personally and professionally implementing these shifts can enrich my success and fulfillment in either. Incredible tools to build strong relationships through speech. Thanks for creating a podcast around being a great man - at home, at work, at fatherhood, at life. It helps me align with my purpose and growth.",

But I’m done with it after the Christian Elliot episode. His very eloquent “18 Reasons Why I’m Not Getting the Vaccine” has become viral anti-vaxxer  fodder. His article was not courageous - it was filled with tired anti-vaxxer arguments and trivializes the millions of people the virus has killed. I’m a physician who has had to isolate from his children, watch patients and relatives die from the disease, watch my fellow doctors and nurses get sick, and I still can’t convince a lot of my patients to get vaccinated because they read garbage like this. Meanwhile, my relatives in Taiwan are desperate for vaccine donations to protect them from the recent surge; his writing feels like a slap in the face in to them. Courage is the people who volunteered for the clinical vaccine trials (with full informed consent btw), not people like Elliot. Jon Vroman celebrating him on this podcast crossed the line for me; I want nothing to do with the brotherhood now. Unfollowing.",

This episode resonated with me personally. I faced a drinking problem a year ago and have now found battles with food (probably as a substitute). I have never really discussed my previous issues with my boys, but feel they need to be aware of addiction signs and consequences. As Jon states, my name I’ve and I can see the clear behavior changes in the boys when they spend too much time on electronics. I am going to take the ideas from this podcast to talk to the kids, on their level, about addiction. It needs to be recognized on all levels and not just affiliated with alcohol and drugs! I think mental health is quickly becoming more of an issue and will be more of a problem in the coming years with the blow back of COVID. Thanks Jon for the great podcasts!",

Yesterday I told him we were shutting off our phones until tomorrow and putting them in a drawer.   We headed to a local park by the beach with a variety of sports equipment, food, blankets, and lanterns.\nWe got home around 9pm and the next day he asked if we could do that once a week.  The connection we had again left me in such a great mood that some people thought I had lost weight or changed my look somehow.  Nope!

In this episode, we are joined by Zach Bush who has a lot of great things to say about getting kids outside.\n\nI agree that kids today are being so sterilized in this war on germs. I love that he talks about “bringing Mother Earth into the nuclear family”. Having them be engaged in Mother Nature. I also agree that more war is not the solution and leads to more death.\n\nThis episode is a serious one and asks bold questions. It makes me wonder where our future is headed if we do not get real about change. Thank you for being unafraid to publish this content that says what others are avoiding. I am not a Dad yet but I still got value.\n\nI like that your episodes vary in length. I enjoy listening to long episodes but also the occasional bite sized episode. These are things that people need to hear. It may not be easy but it is necessary. I recommend this to anyone who is a Dad or just values their family’s future.",

Jon has orchestrated his life in a manner that allows him to eat, sleep and breathe his role as husband, first and foremost, and then father. He works hard to live in the roller coaster of life with his family. There is no juggling of work life balance, it’s just life and this is reflected in his work, play, and all life. He models and brings other models of fatherhood that are exemplary in empowering us as dads to see life differently. Not driven by the typical enculturated beliefs of an American Dream built on the INDIVIDUAL pursuit of happiness but about healthy family systems that drive healthy family relationships, breeding healthy friendships and healthy life engagements in community. If Jon speaks, he speaks from deep listening and his words humbly echo the voices of wisdom he has collected over the years. Thank you Jon for empowering men with kids to fathers of leaders. Love you brother!",

He is as genuine and real as I expected.  It is impressive to see such a successful guy talking about his values around parenting and not about his private jet (he actually has one!  And also doesn’t brag about it!). It truly emphasizes where his values truly are!  Yes, it is great to be successful because you can do more good in the world, but it is also important to participate in your life and with your family.  As a MOM (ie, not officially your target audience), I LOVE hearing dads step up as parents.  Thank you for what you do, it matters!!!",

                "review": "Great episode for Dads and non-Dads alike! I've been following David's work for a couple years now, and this interview provides insight into his motivation and strategic planning when it comes to family that definitely comes out but is not the focus of other more business based podcast interviews. There are golden nuggets throughout the interview, and here are a few that stuck out to me because they made me think harder about my own life: David credits his military upbringing to making him resilient and flexible, but didn't want that lifestyle for his children. I chose, or vowed actually, not to start a family while I was serving in the military because I saw a lot of families that were going through hard times due to all of the uncertainty associated with a military life, and I didn't want that from my family. David's Dad as a hardcore SF officer had a bit of a temper, mine does too... I vowed that I would not treat people that way. David very deliberately chooses the environment he surrounds himself, his wife, and their children with. Living in a neighborhood with great community was more important for him than living in the most luxurious, elite, but likely secluded neighborhood. David's leadership in GoBundance, FamBundance, and Front Row Dads ensure his family is always around the best peer group and going on epic adventures with them. David and Jon both speak about the right balance with having nice things and living a very abundant lifestyle and not \"spoiling\" the kids. By keeping the focus on gratitude and creating an understanding for them that most of the world does not live like we do is critical. Knowing how to work hard is key, and understanding the power of leverage and focusing on thinking and solving big problems will allow those  children to be the best at whatever they choose to do and positively impact the world. The discussion about fully embracing the role of being a the patriarch, regardless of if your Dad is around or not is still around or not, is key.  Dads want to know that their kids are successful leaders, and getting to show my Dad that is a priority of mine. Again, great interview! Must listen for Dads and for those aspiring to have a family someday!",

I appreciate David’s transparency about his childhood and his family. I love the idea of telling a story from your own childhood when reading to your children. What a great way to create curiosity and lead to more questions about your life as well as introspection for yourself. Win-win. \n\nMotivational speaker Jim Rohn has said that we are the average of the five people we spend the most time with. David echoes that when he says, “You have to be around the right kind of people to become the right kind of person. There’s just no other way. People say you change from the inside out. I think you change from the outside in.”\n\nI also value Kindness as a trait the world needs and liked hearing that’s important to David to instill in his children. I enjoyed David’s interview and insight along with Jon’s and appreciate them sharing a glimpse into their personal lives. Finding balance between work and home is difficult for entrepreneurs as our passion for work blurs the boundaries of home life. \n\nI highly recommend you listen to the podcast yourself to glean all the gold nuggets these two accomplished men share. Well done.",
